/* Ideally, we want to distribute the work to the threads so that
 * 1) they never update the same cell
 * 2) they (ideally) have large contiguous regions which they own i.e., 
 * only they write in that region

Dividing based on hashes gives us 1)
Dividing based on locs   gives us 2)
However, since 1) is more important than 2), we went with 1)
Note that locs doesn't give you the location of a key.
It only gives you a starting point for the hunt for the location of a key
